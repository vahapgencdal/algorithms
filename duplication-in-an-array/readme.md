##Question  
An array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-2. There is exactly one number duplicated in the array. How do you find the duplicated number? For example, if an array with length 5 contains numbers {0, 2, 1, 3, 2}, the duplicated number is 2.  

##Answer  
I wont use junit this example for use to learn get bean from context.  

When you search duplicate number.  
you will decrease search cost.  
n,n-1,n-2 ... 0  
so search cost will nlogn
